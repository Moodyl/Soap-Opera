        <p>It is uncertain as to who was the first to invent soap. Ancient Mesopotamians were first to produce a
            kind of soap by cooking fatty acids &ndash; like the fat rendered from a slaughtered cow, sheep or
            goat &ndash; together with water and an alkaline like lye, a caustic substance derived from wood
            ashes. The result was a greasy and smelly goop that lifted away dirt.</p>

        <p>The Ebers papyrus (Egypt, 1550 BC) indicates the ancient Egyptians used soap as a medicine and
            combined animal fats or vegetable oils with a soda ash substance called Trona to create their soaps.
            Egyptian documents mention a similar substance was used in the preparation of wool for weaving.</p>

        <p class="column-2">In the Southern Levant, the ashes from barilla plants, such as species of Salsola,
            saltwort
            (Seidlitzia rosmarinus) and Anabasis, were used in soap production, known as potash. Traditionally,
            olive oil was used instead of animal lard throughout the Levant, which was boiled in a copper
            cauldron for several days. As the boiling progresses, alkali ashes and smaller quantities of
            quicklime were added, and constantly stirred.<br>
            <br>
            In the case of lard, it required constant stirring while kept lukewarm until it began to trace. Once
            it began to thicken, the brew was poured into a mold and left to cool and harden for two weeks.
            After hardening, it was cut into smaller cakes. Aromatic herbs were often added to the rendered soap
            to impart their fragrance, such as yarrow leaves, lavender, germander, etc.

        <p>The word sapo, Latin for soap, likely was borrowed from an early Germanic language and is cognate
            with Latin sebum, "tallow". An early mention of soap comes in Roman scholar Pliny the Elder’s book
            “Naturalis Historia” from A.D. 77. He described soap as a pomade made of tallow &ndash; typically
            derived
            from beef fat &ndash; and ashes that the Gauls, particularly the men, applied to their hair to give
            it “a
            reddish tint.”</p>
        <p>Ancient people used these early soaps to clean wool or cotton fibers before weaving them into cloth,
            rather than for human hygiene. Not even the Greeks and Romans, who pioneered running water and
            public baths, used soap to clean their bodies. Instead, men and women immersed themselves in water
            baths and then afterwards smeared their bodies with scented olive oils. They used a metal or reed
            scraper called a strigil to remove any remaining oil or grime.</p>

        </div>
        <p>By the Middle Ages, new vegetable-oil-based soaps, especially olive oil, which were hailed for their
            mildness and purity and smelled good, had come into use as luxury items among Europe’s most
            privileged classes. The first of these, Aleppo soap, a green, olive-oil-based bar soap infused with
            aromatic laurel oil, was produced in Syria and brought to Europe by Christian crusaders and
            traders.<br>
            <br>
            French, Italian, Spanish and eventually English versions soon followed. Of these, Jabon de Castilla,
            or Castile soap, named for the region of central Spain where it was produced, was the best known.
            The white, olive-oil-based bar soap was a wildly popular toiletry item among European royals.
            Castile soap became a generic term for any hard soap of this type.

        <p>Many of these soaps are still produced, both industrially and by small-scale artisans. Castile soap
            is a popular example of the vegetable-only soaps derived from the oldest "white soap" of Italy.<br>
            <br>
            In 1634 Charles I granted the newly formed Society of Soapmakers a monopoly in soap production who
            produced certificates from 'foure Countesses, and five Viscountesses, and divers other Ladies and
            Gentlewomen of great credite and quality, besides common Laundresses and others', testifying that
            'the New White Soap washeth whiter and sweeter than the Old Soap'.

                A comic critizising the taxing of salt, tobacco and soap, Evan T., 1782, London
            </span>
        </div>
        <p>During the Restoration era (February 1665 &ndash; August 1714) a soap tax was introduced in England,
            which meant that until the mid-1800s, soap was a luxury, used regularly only by the well-to-do. The
            soap manufacturing process was closely supervised by revenue officials who made sure to restrict use
            of soapmakers' equipment. Moreover, soap could not be produced by small makers because of a law that
            stipulated that soap boilers must manufacture a minimum quantity of one imperial ton at each
            boiling, which placed the process beyond the reach of the average person. The soap trade was boosted
            and deregulated when the tax was repealed in 1853.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="column-grid">
        <p>Industrially manufactured bar soaps became available in the late 18th century, as advertising
            campaigns in Europe and America promoted popular awareness of the relationship between cleanliness
            and health. In modern times, the use of soap has become commonplace in western nations due to a
            better understanding of the role of hygiene in reducing plagues and diseases.<br>
            <br>
            American manufacturer Benjamin T. Babbitt introduced marketing innovations that included the sale of
            bar soap and distribution of product samples. William Hesketh Lever and his brother, James, bought a
            small soap works in Warrington in 1886 and founded what is still one of the largest soap businesses,
            formerly called Lever Brothers and now called Unilever.
